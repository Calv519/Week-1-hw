			<p>I graduated from Queens College with a bachelor in economics and minor in psychology.  I am working an office clerk at United Process Service, Inc.  I manage incoming legal papers where I log it into our companyâ€™s database and process affidavit of service for our clients.<br>
			I was always interested in designing website for people, but never knew where to start.  Therefore, one of my goal this year is to complete the entire course in General Assembly to become a front end developer.<br> 
			I have a couple of hobbies that I enjoy.  I like going to concert, raves and discovering new places in the city.</p>
